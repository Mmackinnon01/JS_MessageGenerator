## General Info

In this project, I will be creating a JavaScript based application to create random messages related to physics for the user. This is a trial project to test my newly developed skills with JS and Git Version Control. This is implemented using a JS object containing arrays of possible words that are randomly inserted into a pre-programmed statement and logged to the console.

## Technologies

* JavaScript
